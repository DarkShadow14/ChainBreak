ChainBreak - Strategy Card Game
==========

## Goal
To claim more cards than the opposing player (2 players).

## How to Play
Players take turns selecting a card and then claiming that card and potentially 
some of its surrounding cards until the entire board has been claimed. Each turn
the current player selects a card and a common link between the selected card and
its surroundings. The player can select from the following common links:

* Same Suit
* Multiples of 3
* Multiples of 4
* Multiples of 5
* Face Cards

After the player has selected both a card and a common link they can then press
claim to collect their points and end their turn. All surrounding cards that match
the common link will now be claimed as yours. This includes cards that are claimed
by the other player.
